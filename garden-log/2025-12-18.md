We've all probably heard of Ethereum as an "infinite garden." Way before Devconnect, we've asked ourselves, how does that fit into education, into how humans learn and support each other's journeys?

Infrastructure choices shape culture, whether we admit it or not. We chose to go to sub0 out of curiosity, but were pleasantly surprised by its hackathon, and particularly by Arkiv.

Arkiv stood out as the missing layer we needed for building, because it treats data as infrastructure, not leverage. Making it shared soil, user-owned, verifiable, and composable, without deciding what "value" is for you.

Our platform has grown strong from that soil. In one line, p2pmentor allows anyone to teach, learn, and mentor without intermediaries, while owning their data. It allows shared knowledge to light a path through the dark forest.

Winning at sub0 definitely didn't hit as a finish line. It gave us confidence to treat pedagogy as infrastructure, and to make legible the design primitives behind learning. It surely pushed our lifelong commitments forward, committing from idea to execution.

We're opening a small beta to those nurturing communities of learning, as well as shaping the future of public goods and mechanism design. DM [@p2pmentor](https://x.com/p2pmentor) to get a beta code, if you want to help shape it early.
